                        <p class="card-text">The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. 
                            It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, 
                            a neighboring musteloid. Adult individuals average 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb), and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. 
                            The species is sexually dimorphic, as males are typically 10 to 20% larger. The fur is white, with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. 
                            A thumb is visible on the bear's forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. 
                            Giant pandas have adapted larger molars and expanded temporal fossa to meet their dietary requirements.</p>
            
                            <p>  Giant pandas are only found in six mountains in a few provinces. 
                            They are also found in elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft). Its diet consists almost entirely of bamboo, 
                            making the bear mostly herbivorous, despite being classified in the order Carnivora. The shoot is important to bears, 
                            as it contains starch and is 32% protein, hence pandas evolved the ability to effectively digest starch. They are solitary, 
                            only gathering in times of mating. Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24 months. Potential predators of sub-adult pandas could be the leopard. 
                            Giant pandas heavily rely on olfactory communication to communicate with one another; scent marks are used to chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. 
                            Giant pandas live long lives, with the oldest dying at 38.</p>
                            
                            <p>  As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, 
                            and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. 
                            Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. By March 2015, the wild giant panda population had increased to 1,864 individuals. 
                            In 2016, it was reclassified on the IUCN Red List from "endangered" to "vulnerable", affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda. 
                            In July 2021, Chinese authorities also reclassified the giant panda as vulnerable. The giant panda has often served as China's national symbol, 
                            appeared on Chinese Gold Panda coins since 1982 and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing.</p>

                <div class="card mb-4 shadow">

                        <h2 id="habitat" class="card-title">Habitat</h2>
                        <p class="card-text"> The giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan. 
                            Giant pandas are generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. 
                            Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. After mating, 
                            the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.</p>

                            <p> Pandas were thought to fall into the crepuscular category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn and dusk; however, 
                                pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with activity peaks in the morning, afternoon, and midnight. 
                                The low nutrition quality of bamboo means pandas need to eat more frequently, and due to their lack of major predators, 
                                they can be active at any time of the day. Activity is highest in June and decreases in late summer to autumn with an increase from November through the following March. 
                                Activity is also directly related to the amount of sunlight during colder days. There is a significant interaction of solar radiation, 
                                such that solar radiation has a stronger positive effect on activity levels of panda bears.</p>
                                
                            <p>  Pandas communicate through vocalization and scent marking such as clawing trees or spraying urine. 
                                They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens. 
                                For this reason, pandas do not hibernate, which is similar to other subtropical mammals, and will instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures. 
                                Pandas rely primarily on spatial memory rather than visual memory.</p>
                            
                            <p> Though the panda is often assumed to be docile, it has been known to attack humans. 
                                Pandas have been known to cover themselves in horse manure to protect themselves against cold temperatures.</p>

                <!-- Diet Section -->
                <div class="card mb-4 shadow">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h2 id="diet" class="card-title">Diet</h2>
                        <p class="card-text">Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, 
                            consisting almost exclusively of bamboo (around 99%). However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, 
                            as well as carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from the consumption of bamboo. 
                            The ability to break down cellulose and lignin is very weak, and their main source of nutrients comes from starch and hemicelluloses. 
                            The most important part of their bamboo diet is the shoots, which are rich in starch and have up to 32% protein content. Accordingly, 
                            pandas have evolved a higher capability to digest starches than strict carnivores.</p>

                            <p>    Raw bamboo is toxic, containing cyanide compounds (hence it is always boiled when used for human consumption). 
                                Pandas' body tissues are less able than herbivores to detoxify cyanide, 
                                but their gut microbiomes are significantly enriched in putative genes coding for enzymes related to cyanide degradation, 
                                suggesting that they have cyanide-digesting gut microbes.
                                
                                <p>     During the shoot season, which lasts from April to August, pandas put on a lot of weight, 
                                which allows them to get through the nutrient-scarce period from late August to April, when they feed mostly on bamboo leaves. 
                                The giant panda is a highly specialized animal with unique adaptations and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years. 
                                The average giant panda eats as much as 9 to 14 kg (20 to 31 lb) of bamboo shoots a day to compensate for the limited energy content of its diet. 
                                Ingestion of such a large quantity of material is possible and necessary because of the rapid passage of large amounts of indigestible plant material 
                                through the short, straight digestive tract. It is also noted, however, that such rapid passage of digesta limits the potential of microbial digestion 
                                in the gastrointestinal tract, limiting alternative forms of digestion. Given this voluminous diet, the giant panda defecates up to 40 times a day. 
                                The limited energy input imposed on it by its diet has affected the panda's behavior. 
                                The giant panda tends to limit its social interactions and avoids steeply sloping terrain to limit its energy expenditures.  </p>
                                
                                <p>     It has been estimated that an adult panda absorbs 54.8–66.1 mg (0.846–1.020 gr) of cyanide a day through its diet. 
                                To prevent poisoning, they have evolved anti-toxic mechanisms to protect themselves. 
                                About 80% of the cyanide is metabolized to less toxic thiocyanate and discharged in urine, while the remaining 20% is detoxified by other minor pathways.  </p>
                                
                                <p>   Two of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are adaptations to its bamboo diet. 
                                Anthropologist Russell Ciochon observed: "much like the vegetarian gorilla, the low body surface area to body volume is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. 
                                This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient-poor resources such as bamboo.
                                " Similarly, the giant panda's round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw. 
                                Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.  </p>
                                
                                <p>   The morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya),
                                it only became herbivorous some 2–2.4 mya with the emergence of A. microta. 
                                Genome sequencing of the giant panda suggests that the dietary switch could have initiated from the loss of the sole umami taste receptor, 
                                encoded by the genes TAS1R1 and TAS1R3 (also known as T1R1 and T1R3), resulting from two frameshift mutations within the T1R1 exons. 
                                Umami taste corresponds to high levels of glutamate as found in meat and may have thus altered the food choice of the giant panda. 
                                Although the pseudogenisation (conversion into a pseudogene) of the umami taste receptor in Ailuropoda coincides with the dietary switch to herbivory, 
                                it is likely a result of, and not the reason for, the dietary change. 
                                The mutation time for the T1R1 gene in the giant panda is estimated to 4.2 mya while fossil evidence indicates bamboo consumption in the giant panda species at least 7 mya, 
                                signifying that although complete herbivory occurred around 2 mya, the dietary switch was initiated prior to T1R1 loss-of-function.  </p>
                                
                                <p> Pandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild, such as Fargesia dracocephala and Fargesia rufa. 
                                Only a few bamboo species are widespread at the high altitudes pandas now inhabit. 
                                Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less. 
                                Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, 
                                the giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, 
                                the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. 
                                In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.  </p>
                                
                                <p>  Pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, 
                                so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. 
                                For six years, scientists studied six pandas tagged with GPS collars at the Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. 
                                They took note of their foraging and mating habits and analyzed samples of their food and feces. 
                                The pandas would move from the valleys into the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn. 
                                During the summer months, bamboo shoots rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low calcium rates in the pandas. 
                                During breeding season, the pandas would return to lower altitudes to eat bamboo leaves rich in calcium.</p>
